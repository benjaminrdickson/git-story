My wife and I decided to visit my brother in Florida for a week, but we left midweek and came back the following midweek. While it was an awesome trip, I really wish I would've thought through starting my boot camp while out of town. It was a fun trip, but pretty inconvenient starting the boot camp while not in my own space.
